# ðŸŽ¨ Abstract Console Painter

Welcome to **Abstract Console Painter** â€” a small experimental C# console application that generates an infinite loop of color changes, effectively turning your console window into a minimalistic, ever-shifting "abstract painting."

## ðŸ“· What it does

This application:
- Prints a welcome message.
- Uses `Random` to pick colors.
- Fills the console with different background colors.
- Runs infinitely with a smooth and colorful visual effect.
